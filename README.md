### Hyperparameter Explanation

#### 1. **Population Size**:
- The number of agents (candidate solutions) in the optimization process. A larger population size increases the diversity of solutions and allows the algorithm to explore more areas of the search space.
- **Increase**: More exploration of the search space, higher chance of finding the optimal solution, but longer computation time.
- **Decrease**: Faster execution, less exploration, may result in suboptimal solutions due to limited diversity.

#### 2. **Iterations**:
- How long the algorithm runs and how much optimization is performed. Each iteration allows agents to update their positions in the search space based on gravitational interactions.
- **Increase**: Allows more fine-tuning, better chance to converge to a global optimum, but longer runtime.
- **Decrease**: Faster, but might stop before convergence, risking suboptimal solutions.

#### 3. **Runs**:
- How many independent times the algorithm is executed with different random initializations. Multiple runs allow you to gather statistically significant results and reduce the impact of randomness.
- **Increase**: More robust results by averaging multiple outcomes, reduces impact of randomness, but increases total computation time.
- **Decrease**: Faster, but results may be less reliable due to fewer independent attempts.

#### 4. **Threshold**:
- Use to select features based on their importance or value within an agentâ€™s position. In feature selection, this threshold determines whether a feature is included or excluded from the final feature subset
- **Increase**: Fewer features are selected, leading to simpler models (less overfitting), but may exclude relevant features (risk of underfitting).
- **Decrease**: More features are selected, which may capture more information, but risks overfitting by including irrelevant features.

### Notes

- The first column is considered as the index and it is not considered (so column 0 is the second one)

- The last column is the target
